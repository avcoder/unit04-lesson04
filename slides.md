# DELETE route

- should we use POST or DELETE?
- if choose DELETE:
   - `npm i method-override` and `app.use(methodOverride("_method"))`
   - in home.ejs, replace Delete button:
   ```html
    <form
      method="POST"
      action="/trucks/<%= truck._id %>?_method=DELETE"
      onsubmit="return confirm('Are you sure?')"
    >
      <button class="btn btn-danger">Delete</button>
    </form>
   ``` 
- update router to include `router.delete`
- update truckController.js to include `deleteTruck` function
- update truckHandler.js to include `deleteTruck` function

# Exercise: Agile / Scrum and Storybook Points

Now that the delete functionality is working, senior leadership wishes to stop using the confirm dialog box and replace it with something that looks better / is branded along with the rest of the app.  

- Using a fibonacci scale of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 where 1 is the least amount of work, 8 is most, rate our current delete functionality.  Whatever value you assign, use that as a basis for the next questions:
- Scenario 1: Clicking Delete button redirects to a delete page where user can then Confirm whether they truly want to delete.  If confirmed, it deletes it
- Scenario 2: Clicking Delete button opens a [bootstrap modal component](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/snippets/designs/delete-confirmation-modal.png) where user can then Confirm whether they truly want to delete.  If confirmed, it deletes it
- Exercise #1: Do a Spike task (research task) to investigate how scenarios 2 if/how scenarios can be done (there may be more than one way to do this)
- Exercise #2a: Give a value for Scenario 1 on how hard/difficult/long it might be to complete this task
- Exercise #2b: Give a value for Scenario 2 on how hard/difficult/long it might be to complete this task

# Exercise: Implement new Delete functionality
30 mins

- Based on your discussions on the previous slide, implement the Delete functionality using Bootstrap
- (in the style of Gameshow Amazing Race)
   - if you come across a blocker, document it
   - can use chatGPT to help
- SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   1. Can you simply display the delete page/modal?
   1. Upon clicking the Cancel button, does it go back to the main page or redirect to '/'
   1. Upon clicking Delete button, does it delete then route back to '/'.  The screen should reflect the removal of that previous food truck.

# Serve static files
Add upload photo functionality

- `npm i jimp multer uuid`
- update truckModel.js to include `photo: String,`
- update router.js to include an `truckController.upload` and `truckController.resize`
- in truckController.js, create `upload` and `resize` functions

# Set up connect-flash

- connect-flash is used to show success messages, error messages, info etc.
- How does it work?
   - if you wish to pass any message, use: `req.flash()`
   - pass in a type of message, and an actual message
   - connect-flash will then stick that info in the next request object (via sessions)
   - That info will then clean up after itself after that 1st request
- in app.js:
  ```js
  import flash from "connect-flash";
  import { notFound, flashValidationErrors } from "./handlers/errorHandlers.js";

  app.use(flash());

  res.locals.flashes = req.flash(); // flash messages (ex: success, error, info)

  app.use(flashValidationErrors); // flash validation errors
  ```
- create `flashValidationErrors()` in errorHandlers.js
- in truckController.js, insert `req.flash("success", `/${truck.slug} added successfully!`)`
